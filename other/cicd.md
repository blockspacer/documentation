# Introduction

In software engineering, [CI/CD or CICD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) may refer to the combined practices of continuous integration and continuous delivery.

In software engineering, continuous integration [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) is the practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. Grady Booch first proposed the term CI in his 1991 method,[2] although he did not advocate integrating several times a day. Extreme programming (XP) adopted the concept of CI and did advocate integrating more than once per day â€“ perhaps as many as tens of times per day.

[Ci/CD](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)>) is a computer program that performs operating-system-level virtualization, also known as "containerization". It was first released in 2013 and is developed by Docker, Inc.

[Continuous delivery (CD or CDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, doing so manually. It aims at building, testing, and releasing software with greater speed and frequency. The approach helps reduce the cost, time, and risk of delivering changes by allowing for more incremental updates to applications in production. A straightforward and repeatable deployment process is important for continuous delivery.

CD contrasts with continuous deployment, a similar approach in which software is also produced in short cycles but through automated deployments rather than manual ones.
