# Introduction
[React (also known as React.js or ReactJS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. Complex React applications usually require the use of additional libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API.
